# strikethru

strikethru is a Google Chrome plug-in that aggregates news data to help consumers make conscious buying decisions. strikethru is still in development, but currently allows the user to track whatever issues are pertinent to them across multiple websites and even synced across Chrome browsers.

## Features currently in development

- an internally-built webscraper for vetted websites
- an alert system for if a user navigates to the website of a company that is currently on strike, has a major enviromental violation, etc.
- a machine-learning algorithm to quantify a company's "grade" for each "out-of-the-box" category

strikethru project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) + currently utilizes the [News API](https://newsapi.org/)
