## strikethru

strikethru is a Google Chrome plug-in that aggregates news data to help consumers make conscious buying decisions. strikethru is still in development, but currently allows the user to track whatever issues are pertinent to them across multiple websites and even synced across Chrome browsers.

Eventually, strikethru will have its own webscraper for vetted websites and an alert system for if a user navigates to the website of a company that is currently on strike, has a major enviromental violation, etc.

strikethru project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) + currently utilizes the [News APP](https://newsapi.org/)
